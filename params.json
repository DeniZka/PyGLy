{"name":"Pygly","body":"# Introduction\r\nPyGLy is a flexible OpenGL framework that sits ontop of [Pyglet](http://www.pyglet.org/).\r\n\r\nPyGLy's core values are the following:\r\n\r\n* FRAMEWORK, not an engine. Program any way you want.\r\n* FLEXIBLE, don't force any one method upon the user\r\n* FULL CONTROL at all times. Full access to rendering, objects, data. No obfuscation. No 'awesome' tricks. Just good, simple code.\r\n* EASY INSTALLATION. No crazy C++ bindings and complex build procedures.\r\n* EXPOSE as much functionality as possible. Lower classes are always accessible or usable on their own.\r\n* LOOSE COUPLING. Code designed to be reused in various situations.\r\n* OPTIONAL high level classes. Low level code is always usable. High level API is optional.\r\n* EXAMPLES of high quality.\r\n* PYTHON to the core.\r\n* SPEED in development. Provide convenience functions where it makes sense.\r\n\r\n\r\n![Twisted Pair Development](http://twistedpairdevelopment.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/twisted_pair-0086.png)\r\nPyGLy is developed by [Twisted Pair Development](http://twistedpairdevelopment.wordpress.com/).\r\n\r\nFollow us on Twitter: [#twistedpairdev](https://twitter.com/#!/TwistedPairDev)","tagline":"Pure Python Open GL framework built on top of Pyglet","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
