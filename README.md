PyGLy
=====================

PyGLy is a flexible OpenGL framework that sits ontop of Pyglet.

PyGLy's aims are:

   * To NOT be an engine
   * To NOT force any one method upon the user
   * To be as flexible as possible
   * To not hide functionality

PyGLy is in active development and is currently alpha software, but is already usable for many situations.

If you want to experiement with OpenGL without having to worry about writing camera's, viewports and scene graphs. Then
PyGLy is perfect for you.


Features
-------------

   * Cross-platform - actively developed on Windows and OS-X.
   * Modular design - Take almost any part of PyGLy and use it on its own.
   * Framework design, not an engine - Don't like an existing class? Don't use it!
   * Multiple Window and viewport support.
   * Multiple parallel scene graphs.
   * Full control over rendering process.
   * Maths helper classes - Quaternion, Matrix, Vectors.
   * NumPy - Translate vectors and matrices en-masse.
   * Mesh loading support - MD2 loading and animation only at the moment.
   * Liberal licensing - Do what you want.
