PyGLy
=====================

PyGLy is a flexible OpenGL framework that sits ontop of Pyglet.

PyGLy's core values are the following:

   * FRAMEWORK, not an engine. Program any way you want.
   * FLEXIBLE, don't force any one method upon the user
   * FULL CONTROL at all times. Full access to rendering, objects, data. No obfuscation. No 'awesome' tricks. Just good, simple code.
   * EASY INSTALLATION. No crazy C++ bindings and complex build procedures.
   * EXPOSE as much funcitonality as possible. Lower classes are always accessible or usable on their own.
   * LOOSE COUPLING. Code designed to be reused in various sitations.
   * OPTIONAL high level classes. Low level code is always usable. High level API is optional.
   * EXAMPLES of high quality.
   * PYTHON to the core.
   * SPEED in development. Provide convenience functions where it makes sense.

If you want to experiement with OpenGL without having to worry about writing camera's, viewports and scene graphs. Then
PyGLy is perfect for you.


Features
-------------

   * Cross-platform - actively developed on Windows and OS-X.
   * Easy to install - Written in pure python and making use of Pyglet for windowing.
   * Modular design - Take almost any part of PyGLy and use it on its own.
   * Framework design, not an engine - Don't like an existing class? Don't use it!
   * Multiple Window and viewport support.
   * Multiple parallel scene graphs.
   * Full control over rendering process.
   * Maths helper classes - Quaternion, Matrix, Vectors.
   * NumPy - Translate vectors and matrices en-masse.
   * Mesh loading support - MD2 loading and animation only at the moment.
   * Duck-typing - Replace any class with your own. Just meet the minimal inter-object contracts.
   * Liberal licensing - Do what you want!
   * Active development - Being developed for games.
